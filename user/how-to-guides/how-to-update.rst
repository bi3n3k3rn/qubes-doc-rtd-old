How to update
=============

*This page is about updating your system while staying on the
same*\ `supported version of Qubes
OS </doc/supported-releases/#qubes-os>`__\ *. If you’re instead looking
to upgrade from your current version of Qubes OS to a newer version, see
the*\ `Upgrade Guides </doc/upgrade/>`__\ *.*

Security updates
================

Security updates are an extremely important part of keeping your Qubes
installation secure. When there is an important security issue, we will
issue a `Qubes Security Bulletin (QSB) </security/qsb/>`__ via the
`Qubes Security Pack (``qubes-secpack``) </security/pack/>`__. It is
very important to read each new QSB and follow any user instructions it
contains. Most of the time, simply `updating your system
normally <#routine-updates>`__ will be sufficient to obtain security
updates. However, in some cases, special action may be required on your
part, which will be explained in the QSB.

Routine updates
===============

It is important to keep your Qubes OS system up-to-date to ensure you
have the latest `security updates <#security-updates>`__, as well as the
latest non-security enhancements and bug fixes.

Fully updating your Qubes OS system means updating:

-  `dom0 </doc/glossary/#dom0>`__
-  `templates </doc/glossary/#template>`__
-  `standalones </doc/glossary/#standalone>`__ (if you have any)

You can accomplish this using the **Qubes Update** tool. (**Warning:**
This tool is currently affected by bug
`#6585 <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/6585>`__. See
below for a mitigation.)

|Qubes Update|

By default, the Qubes Update tool will appear as an icon in the
Notification Area when updates are available.

|Qube Updates Available|

However, you can also start the tool manually by selecting it in the
Applications Menu under “System Tools.” Even if no updates have been
detected, you can use this tool to check for updates manually at any
time by selecting “Enable updates for qubes without known available
updates,” then selecting all desired items from the list and clicking
“Next.”

Command-line interface
======================

.. container:: alert alert-danger

   Warning: Updating exclusively with direct commands such as
   qubes-dom0-update, dnf update, and apt update is not recommended,
   since these bypass built-in Qubes OS update security measures.
   Instead, we strongly recommend first using the Qubes Update tool or
   its command-line equivalents, as described below, then using the
   direct commands for confirmation (see #6585 and PR #79). (By
   contrast, installing packages using direct package manager commands
   is fine.)

As a temporary mitigation until
`#6585 <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/6585>`__ is
fixed, the following update sequence is recommended (see `PR
#79 <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-posts/pull/79>`__ for explanation
and discussion):

1. Update dom0 with Salt.
2. Update dom0 by direct command.
3. Update templates and standalones with Salt.
4. Update templates and standalones by direct commands.

Example using only the command line (all commands with ``sudo`` or as
root):

1. In dom0: ``qubesctl --show-output state.sls update.qubes-dom0``
2. In dom0: ``qubes-dom0-update --clean -y``
3. In dom0:
   ``qubesctl --show-output --skip-dom0 --templates state.sls    update.qubes-vm``
4. In dom0:
   ``qubesctl --show-output --skip-dom0 --standalones state.sls    update.qubes-vm``
5. In every Fedora template and standalone: ``dnf -y --refresh upgrade``
6. In every Debian template and standalone:
   ``apt-get clean && apt-get -y update    && apt-get -y dist-upgrade && apt-get clean``

Qubes 4.0
---------

Advanced users may wish to perform updates via the command-line
interface. The recommended way to do this is by using the command-line
equivalents of the **Qubes Update** tool.

There are two Salt formulae and two corresponding ``qubesctl`` commands:
- ```update.qubes-dom0`` </doc/salt/#updatequbes-dom0>`__ -
```update.qubes-vm`` </doc/salt/#updatequbes-vm>`__

Advanced users may also be interested in learning `how to enable the
testing repos </doc/testing/>`__.

Qubes 4.1
---------

The recommendation, commands, and Salt formulae from 4.0 remain the
same.

Command-line updates in dom0 behave differently in 4.1. In your update
qube, a terminal window opens that displays the progress of operations
and output as it is logged. At the end of the process, logs are sent
back to dom0. You answer any yes/no prompts in your dom0 terminal
window.

Upgrading to avoid EOL
======================

The above covers updating *within* a given operating system (OS)
release. Eventually, however, most OS releases will reach **end-of-life
(EOL)**, after which point they will no longer be supported. This
applies to Qubes OS itself as well as OSes used in
`templates </doc/templates/>`__ (and
`standalones </doc/standalones-and-hvms/>`__, if you have any).

**It’s very important that you use only supported releases so that you
continue to receive security updates.** This means that you *must*
periodically upgrade Qubes OS and your templates before they reach EOL.
You can always see which versions of Qubes OS and select templates are
supported on the `Supported Versions </doc/supported-releases/>`__ page.

In the case of Qubes OS itself, we will make an
`announcement </news/categories/#releases>`__ when a supported Qubes OS
release is approaching EOL and another when it has actually reached EOL,
and we will provide `instructions for upgrading to the next stable
supported Qubes OS release </doc/upgrade/>`__.

Periodic upgrades are also important for templates. For example, you
might be using a `Fedora template </doc/templates/fedora/>`__. The
`Fedora Project <https://getfedora.org/>`__ is independent of the Qubes
OS Project. They set their own
`schedule <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle#Maintenance_Schedule>`__
for when each Fedora release reaches EOL. You can always find out when
an OS reaches EOL from the upstream project that maintains it. We also
pass along any EOL notices we receive for official template OSes as a
convenience to Qubes users (see `Supported Versions:
Templates </doc/supported-releases/#templates>`__).

The one exception to all this is the specific release used for dom0 (not
to be confused with Qubes OS as a whole), which `doesn’t have to be
upgraded </doc/supported-releases/#note-on-dom0-and-eol>`__.
